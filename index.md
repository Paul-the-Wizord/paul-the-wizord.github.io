I am Paul, a Mathematics PhD student at the University of TÃ¼bingen, with a strong interest in (quantum) information theory, computer science and physics.

Although I greatly enjoyed my time as a researcher in mathematical physics and quantum information theory, I also have a strong interest in more applied fields such as statistics, machine learning, and data science, and feel that my place is less in the purely academic world. I am therefore now looking to transition to industry where I can still utilize the analytical skills and initiative I acquired during my PhD and before.
