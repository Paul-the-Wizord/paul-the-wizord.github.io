description: These are some lecture notes that I accumulated in my time as a student and after. No guarantee that these are correct or complete nor necessarily properly formatted. I happily provided you with the LaTeX code of the notes upon request and further with my lecture notes on "Experimentalphysik IV und V", that possibly contain copyright material, which is why I am not posting them here.
